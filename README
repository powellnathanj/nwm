nwm - Nathan's Window Manager
============================
This will be my fork of dwm.  Not many changes at this point.


A note about platforms
------------

I have made changes so that dwm will compile on FreeBSD and Linux without making changes. 

You have to set the OS flag in config.mk

However, the issue becomes incompatibilities in BSD Make and Gnu Make.  In having to choose
one, I chose Gnu's Make.  When building for FreeBSD, use `gmake` and not `make`.

So:

  gmake
  sudo gmake install

xinerama support
------------

I removed xinerama support from my build.  I will probably add it back in at some point, but 
I don't have a lot of use for it.

Original README:


dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

If you are going to use the default bluegray color scheme it is highly
recommended to also install the bluegray files shipped in the dextra package.


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while true
    do
        xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
        sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
